## General <a name="general"></a>

This README contains Webtables papers and resources. Summaries are by [@workindead](https://github.com/workinDead), to the best of our abilities after reading each paper or testing the system (when available). We welcome pull requests with additional resources, papers, or data.

* Brief Introduction

  Tables are a practical and useful tool in many applications seenarios. Tables can be effectively utilized for collecting and organizing information from multiple sources. With the help of additional operations, usch as sorting, filtering and joins, this information can be turned into knowledge and, ultimately, can be used to support decision-making. Thanks to their convenience and utility, a large number of tables are being produced and are made available on the Web. These tables represent a valuable resource and have been a focus of research for over two decades now. 

  Tables on the web, referred to as web tables henceforth, referred to as *web tables* henceforth, differ from traditional tables (that is, tables in relational databases and tables created in spreadsheet programs) in a number of ways. First, web tables are embedded in webpages. There is a lot of contextual information, such as the embedding page's title and link structure, the surrounding text, etc. that can be utilized. Second, web tables are rather heterogeneous regarding their quality, organization, and content. For example, tables on the Web are often used for layout and navigation purposes.

  Among the different table types, *relational tables* (also referred to as *genuine tables*) are of special interest. These describe a set of entities (such as people, organizations, locations, etc.) along with their attributes. Relational tables are considered to be of high-quality, because of the relational knowledge contained in them. However, unlike from tables in relational databases, these relationships are not made explicit in web tables; uncovering them is one of the main research challenges. The uncovered semantics can be leveraged in various applications, including table search, question answering, knowledge base augmentation, and table completion. For each of these tasks we identify seminal work, describe the key ideas behind the proposed approaches, discuss relevant resources, and point out interdependencies among the different tasks.

## Literature Reviews <a name="reviews"></a>

* [Web Table Extraction, Retrieval, and Augmentation: A survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00207) Most up-to-date literature review (Jan. 2020), covering six table-related information access tasks: Table Extraction, Table Interpretation, Table Search, Table Augmentation, Knowledge Base Augmentation, Question Answering
* [Ten Years of WebTables](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/papers/p2140-cafarella.pdf) WebTables, the very first system to identify  databases from HTML tables. This paper not only uncovers sub-projects within a decade but also discusses the real impact of this system such as production corpus construction, google tables and etc. 

## Papers -  Table Extraction <a name="papers_te"></a>

Based on three main types of web tables, approaches for table extraction task are organized below:

## Papers -  QA on Tables <a name="papers_qat"></a>

1. Traditional methods:

   **Semantic Parsing**

- [Compositional semantic parsing on semi-structured tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00305) Question answering from tables is seen as a semantic parsing task where the question is translated to a logical form that can be executed against a knowledge base.

2. Creative methods: 

   **Neural Network**

- [TAPAS: Weakly Supervised Table Parsing via Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02349)  TAPAS find answers without generating logical forms, by extending the [BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) architecture to encode the question jointly along with tabular data structure, resulting in a model that can then point directly to the answer.[Github Repo](https://github.com/google-research/tapas)
